1. Explain the difference between the = operator and the == operator in Python.

"=" : this is an assignment operator, which is used to assign the value to a variable
     eg: name="Jhon"
         age=25
"==" : this is a compare operator, which is used to compare two values to check if they are equal. It returns "True" if values are equal, return "False" if not equal 
     eg: a=19
         b=20
         print(a==b)

2. What does the ** operator do in Python, and how is it used?

** : This operator is used for exponent. It raises a number to the power of another number.
eg: power=2**3
    print(power)            #it return 8

3. What does the ^ operator do in Python, and in what context is it commonly used?
   ^ : this operator is a bitwise XOR operator. it operates on the binary representation of integer.
     it compares each bit of its operands, if the corresponding bits of the two operands are different then, it returns 1.
   
   eg: x=12         #binary: 1100
       y=7          #binary: 0111
       result=x^b
       print(result)           #output will be 11, binary(1011)
